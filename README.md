# R-Syntax
## A University of Calgary Library Worskshop
This is an introductory presentation to the workshop on the R base syntax, the open-source language of statistics, mathematics, and data visualization.

## Why R

R was created to offer a free alternative to the S language. It grew from a world community of statisticians and scientists enamoured with its expressive power and accuracy.
R is interoperable with C++ and Rust for high-performance numerical computing. It is functional, object, vector and graphics-oriented.

R has unique features: multi-dispatch methods, two object models and vectorized operations implemented from the ground up. 

In today's fast-paced technological world, with AI agents for everything, R data processing can make a difference in terms of tight control of the data modelling and visualization pipelines.
Every scientist and research engineer benefits from having the expressiveness and conciseness of the base R syntax, or the verbosity and clarity of the tidyverse syntax.

R is a language of choices. This Workshop aims at demystifying the R syntax by explaining the basic concepts, the data types and the data structures, and the rules that allow working with them productively.

The philosophy of the workshop is to explain fundamentals that will unlock the myriad resources available online.
